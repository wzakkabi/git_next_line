# git_next_line

## Description
`git_next_line` is a simple implementation of the `get_next_line` function, which reads a line from a file descriptor. This project is designed to provide a clear and concise implementation of `get_next_line`, suitable for learning and educational purposes.

## Features
- Provides a basic implementation of the `get_next_line` function.
- Reads a line from a file descriptor and returns it without the newline character.
- Handles reading from multiple file descriptors simultaneously.
- Supports custom buffer sizes for optimization.

## Getting Started
To use `git_next_line` in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/wzakkabi/git_next_line.git

2. Compile the source files:

gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=32 get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c main.c -o gnl

3. Run the executable:
./gnl

## Usage
Here's an example demonstrating the usage of `git_next_line`:

```c
#include "get_next_line.h"
#include <fcntl.h>

int main() {
 int fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);
 char *line;
 while (get_next_line(fd, &line) > 0) {
     printf("%s\n", line);
     free(line);
 }
 close(fd);
 return 0;
}
```
